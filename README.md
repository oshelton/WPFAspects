Jack "Owen" Shelton Common WPF Components and Utilities

WPF Aspects

# Intro

This project includes classes and interfaces needed to implement various application features.

These features include:
* Complex property based object validation.
  * Including base classes for model and view model classes. 
* Object property change tracking for simple dirty/clean tracking that allows for basic undo/redo support.
* Many commonly used and needed WPF converter classes.
* Simplified command classes.
* Several commonly needed WPF utility classes (visual and logical tree walking, etc).
